			<h4>Data protection</h4>
			Your data will be anonymized and only used in the manner described in our data protection sheet,

The processing and use of the collected data occurs in a pseudoanonymized form within the scope of the legally prescribed provisions.
As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of answered questionnaires, as well as electronic data, for a duration of 10 years or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.

By providing of further personal data in pseudoanonymized form, collected personal data may be used for the preparation of anonymized
scientific research work and may also be published and used in an anonymized form in medical journals and scientific publications, so that a direct assignment to my person cannot be established.

The information obtained during the course of this study may also be sent in an anonymized form to cooperation partners within the scope of
the European General Data Protection Regulation for scientific purposes and to cooperation partners outside of the European Union, i.e. to countries with a lower data protection level (this also applies to the USA).

The data collected within the scope of the study can also be used and processed in the future inside of the Max Planck Institute.

I was informed about my rights, that at any time:

I can withdraw this declaration of consent.

I can request information about my stored data and request the correction or blocking of data.

By cancellation of my participation in the study,
I can request that any personal data of mine collected until that point are immediately deleted or anonymized.

I can request that my personal data are handed out to me or to third parties (if technically feasible).

I herewith declare that:

I have been adequately informed about the collection and processing of my personal data and rights.

I consent to the collection and processing of personal data within the scope of the study and its pseudoanonymized disclosure,
so that only the persons conducting the study can establish a link between the data and my person.

Agreement:

I agree to participate in this experiment.

I consent to the use of my data described in the Data Protection Information Sheet
and confirm having received a copy of the Data Protection Sheet.

I consent to data transfer.

            This study explores how people make decisions in real-life contexts..<br>
            In each question, you will see two items that are characterized by two features.<br>
            You then have to decide which of these two items scores higher on a third feature that is shown in the question.<br>
            Please make a decision in each question based on your <b>intuition</b>. There are no correct or wrong answers. <br>
            <br>
            Now you will be presented with the questions as shown in the example below, each question will offer two options; F and J.<br>
            To answer the questions, please use the keyboard buttons F and J on your keyboard.<br>
